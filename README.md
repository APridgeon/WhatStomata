# WhatStomata

A javascript based game using the Phaser3 engine that I started to make. The idea was this could be used potentially for science outreach events to introduce people to the concept of stomata and plant gas exchange control. Additionally, this was a project I started to learn javascript (having no major exposure to the language prior to this - so don't judge the code!). Although uncomplete, here is a rough idea of what this game would have become. All of the code is here, so please contribute.

## Aims
Balance the uptake of CO2 with water loss <br />
Prevent water levels from running out <br />
Accumulate as much biomass as possible (biomass is essentially the score) <br />
Adapt the behaviour of stomata to suit the current conditions (ie if drought is occuring water loss will increase) <br />


## Future Ideas
Add night and day (close stomata at night, open in the day - unless a CAM plant?) <br />
Add more upgrades <br />
Add better instructions <br />
