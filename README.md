# WhatStomata

A javascript based game using the Phaser3 engine that I started to make. The idea was this could be used potentially for science outreach events to introduce people to the concept of stomata and plant gas exchange control. Although uncomplete, there as a rough idea of what this game would have become.

## Aims
Balance the uptake of CO2 with water loss
Prevent water levels from running out
Accumulate as much biomass as possible (biomass is essentially the score)
Adapt the behaviour of stomata to suit the current conditions (ie if drought is occuring water loss will increase)
